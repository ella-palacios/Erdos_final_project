# Forest Fire and Bio-Diversity Project Notes:
**The purpose of this living document is to have a place to put all thoughts and outside research from each group member in one place.** 

### Information About Previous Related Projects:

The purpose of this section is to explore and summarize previous Erd√∂s and Academic projects that may relate to our proposed research question. 
**Forest Fire Prediction** *Fall 2023, Team 36* Their project surrounds the data involved in what weather patterns cause forest fires and given a specific weather pattern can we predict if a fire could/will ignite. They used the natural factors such as rainfall, relative humidity, and temperature as primary indicators of if a fire will or will not ignite. 

**Predicting land cover using GEDI-L2A tree canopy data for New York State** *May-Summer 2024, Team 41*. The aim of this project was find a correlation between tree canopy cover and tree height -- which could indicate tree health. Only link to wildfires was where this project could be applicable, such as wildfire researchers could use this to understand tree health and where wildfires may or may not spread/ignite. (Fun Fact: Ella went to undergrad with one of the people that worked on this project). 

**Predicting Forest Cover Types and Visualizing Data** *Team 71, Fall 2023* The goal of this project was to, given a current map of forest data, can we predict future tree covers and what is the minimal amount of data we need to predict this. They used a topological based algorithm, which is actually really interesting.
Note: This project is likely most similar to what we could be doing, but I think we've veered in a slightly different direction. Please correct me (Ella) if I'm wrong. 

### Our Project
**Research Question:** Can we predict how a forest regenerates following a fire given the soil make up and previous bio-diversity? 
**Project Plan:** We plan to investigate if we can can predict forest regeneration via the bio-diversity data in trees (potentially also insects/birds but potentially trees might be enough -- OR if we could find some biodiversity index, mathematically?) follwoing a forest fire. We plan to investigate geographical areas in the United States where major fires are present, such as Washington, Oregon, & Idaho.
