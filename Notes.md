# Forest Fire and Bio-Diversity Project Notes:
**The purpose of this living document is to have a place to put all thoughts and outside research from each group member in one place.** 

### Information About Previous Related Projects:
The purpose of this section is to explore and summarize previous Erd√∂s and Academic projects that may relate to our proposed research question.  

**Forest Fire Prediction** *Fall 2023, Team 36* Their project surrounds the data involved in what weather patterns cause forest fires and given a specific weather pattern can we predict if a fire could/will ignite. They used the natural factors such as rainfall, relative humidity, and temperature as primary indicators of if a fire will or will not ignite. 

**Predicting land cover using GEDI-L2A tree canopy data for New York State** *May-Summer 2024, Team 41*. The aim of this project was find a correlation between tree canopy cover and tree height -- which could indicate tree health. Only link to wildfires was where this project could be applicable, such as wildfire researchers could use this to understand tree health and where wildfires may or may not spread/ignite. (Fun Fact: Ella went to undergrad with one of the people that worked on this project). 

**Predicting Forest Cover Types and Visualizing Data** *Team 71, Fall 2023* The goal of this project was to, given a current map of forest data, can we predict future tree covers and what is the minimal amount of data we need to predict this. They used a topological based algorithm, which is actually really interesting.
Note: This project is likely most similar to what we could be doing, but I think we've veered in a slightly different direction. Please correct me (Ella) if I'm wrong. 

**Predicting Wildfire Spread** *Team 78, Fall 2022* The goal of this project was to predict where wildfires will spread once started using features like windspeed/wind direction/previous fire perimeter and minimum temperature. They used a convolutional neural network. 


### Our Project
**Research Question:** Can we predict how a forest regenerates following a fire given the soil make up and previous bio-diversity?   
**Project Plan:** We plan to investigate if we can can predict forest regeneration via the bio-diversity data in trees (potentially also insects/birds but potentially trees might be enough -- OR if we could find some biodiversity index, mathematically?) follwoing a forest fire. We plan to investigate geographical areas in the United States where major fires are present, such as Washington, Oregon, & Idaho.

This seems relevant, although it's highly specific.

**General Observations/Notes**  
Everyone should give this a read and we may be able to use some the results for our project: https://www.mdpi.com/1999-4907/14/4/709.  
Here's what my thought had been, if we could find some sort of mathematical formula for an index of biodiversity in a given area, we could then compile data to understand that index and see how that index changes after a fire. This would encompass trees, wildlife, soil quality etc since the entire ecosystem relies on each of these things. The paper focuses primarily on forest ecosystems which would fit our project well.
