# Thrive or Survive: Predicting the Health of Trees following Forest Fires in Washington 
A project by Henry Cladouhos, Allie Cruikshank, Christina Duffield, & Ella Palacios

## Overview
#### Motivation:
The motivation behind this project is to build a model that can accurately predict the survival and health of trees 
following a forest fire, given previous health data. We picked the state of Washington to begin developing the model 
due to its diverse boreal & arboreal ecosystems at varying elevations that fall victim to yearly forest fires. Preserving 
Washington forests is a passion of ours. 

#### Question:
Can we predict tree survival and health following a fire, using data about the treeâ€™s past health and the fire severity?

#### Stakeholders: 
- Disaster Mitigation Groups
- Commercial Logging
- Forestry Researchers

#### KPI:
Accuracy of tree survival predictions post-fire when compared with actual historic outcomes

## File Organization
This Github is divided into three folders. They are described below in the general logical order that you should access them
to understand the project.

#### Data
The Data folder contains...
- Raw files downloaded from our data sources (FIA datamart and NIFC)
- FeaturesToKeep.md, which lists features from the TREE dataset that we wanted to bring into our combined data.
