### Stakeholders:
Forestry service, disaster mitigation groups, commercial logging, environmentalists

### KPIs:
Comparing our predicted tree diameter/height/crown health vs actual historical data after fires


### Datasets:

FIA Datamart Washington data (maybe other states too?)

NOAA historical fire data (once it is accessible again - will need to check how extensive their data is)

USDA Research Data Archive - fire recovery study in Maine

Any others I'm forgetting?
