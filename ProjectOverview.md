Research Question: Can we predict future forest long-term health following a fire given soil make-up/quality and historical forest health? Project Plan: We plan to investigate if we can can predict forest regeneration via overall tree health and soil-makeup data following a forest fire. We plan to investigate geographical areas in the United States where major fires are present, such as Washington, Oregon, & Idaho.

### Stakeholders:
Forestry service, disaster mitigation groups, commercial logging, environmentalists

### KPIs:
Comparing our predicted tree diameter/height/crown health vs actual historical data after fires


### Datasets:

FIA Datamart Washington data (maybe other states too?): https://research.fs.usda.gov/products/dataandtools/tools/fia-datamart

NOAA historical fire data (once it is accessible again - will need to check how extensive their data is)

USDA Research Data Archive - fire recovery study in Maine

Any others I'm forgetting?
