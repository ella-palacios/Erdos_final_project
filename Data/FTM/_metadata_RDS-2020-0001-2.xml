      <abstract>The Fire and Tree Mortality (FTM) database includes standardized observations of fire injury and survival or mortality for 171,177 individual tree-level observations, representing 142 tree species across the United States. Of these, 7,191 trees have burned twice. These trees were burned in 420 prescribed fires and wildfires occurring in 35 years, from 1981 to 2016. The database was developed using 41 contributed datasets from researchers, managers, and archived data products. At a minimum, datasets had to contain measurements of individual trees, size, fire injury, and post-fire survival, but some datasets include additional data such as bark beetle attack. Only trees that were alive before the fire were included in the database. We included any trees where post-fire status was measured within 10 years of the fire. If a tree re-burned in a subsequent fire, and post-fire injury and status information were available after that fire, then a new record (row) was made for that tree after the second fire.</abstract>
      <purpose>The purpose of the FTM database is to provide access to data on individual tree mortality or top-kill from wildland and prescribed fire. By pooling as many individual datasets as possible and creating consistent variables, data analysis with a much larger sample size is feasible. The FTM database also allows easy identification of data gaps to direct future data collection efforts. The FTM database also allows evaluation of post-fire mortality models, such as the First Order Fire Effects Model (FOFEM), BehavePlus, and the Fire and Fuels Extension to the Forest Vegetation Simulator (FFE-FVS).</purpose>
      <supplinf>This data publication is a 2nd edition of the FTM database. The first edition (https://doi.org/10.2737/RDS-2020-0001) was originally published on 05/14/2020. This 2nd edition includes data updates such as a change to the format of live / dead status for years where data were not collected in the field, updates to the format of unobserved (NA) values, and additional data corrections. A thorough description of these updates is described in the process steps below.</supplinf>

    <attracc>
      <attraccr>We used summary tables and data visualization to check for outliers, impossible values, and duplicated records. We corresponded with data contributors when additional clarification was needed. Examples on impossible values include: tree status could not change from dead in one year and alive in a subsequent year; percentage values must be 0 to 100; species must lay within established range maps.</attraccr>
    </attracc>
    <logic>For each contributed dataset, we created consistently named variables, consistent labeled levels of categorical variables, and made units consistent for each variable. See methodology section for more details.</logic>
    <complete>To be included in the database, at a minimum, datasets had to contain measurements of individual trees, stem diameter, fire injury, and post-fire survival. Tree records without species identified were retained for the purposes of being able to calculate plot-level metrics. Many datasets included more variables that the required minimum. We retained variables on fire-caused injuries and biotic agents from the original datasets. 
	
"NA" is used to represent not applicable or not assessed, see variable descriptions for details. There are also some cases of "not available", which means we do not have this information.</complete>

        <methdesc>OBTAINING DATA

To construct our FTM database, the lead authors (Cansler, Hood, Varner, van Mantgem) conducted a literature search for publications reporting post-fire tree mortality data and contacted corresponding authors to inquire if they were willing to contribute to database. To collect additional data, we also posted data requests on listservs, professional management and science exchange networks, and with technical working groups. Lastly, we coordinated with the National Park Service to receive the agency’s fire ecology program fire effects monitoring data. From these data requests and searches, we obtained 41 contributed databases from researchers, managers, and archived datasets that met our criteria (see Completeness Report).
				
STANDARDIZATION
		
For each contributed dataset, we created consistently named variables, consistent labeled levels of categorical variables, and made units consistent for each variable. 

We standardized the fire location and fire year data for all observations. Because location data in contributed datasets were provided at inconsistent scales (including tree, plot, research site, and fire names) we standardized all location data used in this analysis to the scale of a fire event. If tree or plot coordinates were provided, we took the average of those coordinates to provide one coordinate for the fire event. If only research site coordinates were provided, but multiple fires occurred with different start dates, then we replicated those coordinates for each fire event. If a fire name and year was provided, and no coordinates were provided, then we searched the Monitoring Trends in Burn Severity database (Monitoring Trends in Burn Severity 2019) for the fire, downloaded the fire geospatial data, and used the coordinates of the centroid of the fire perimeter for this analysis.

Only trees that were alive before the fire were included in the database. We included any trees where post-fire status was measured within 10 years of the fire. When possible, we populated live and dead status for years when field measurements were not taken: if a tree was alive, it was coded as live in previous years, and if a tree was dead, it was coded as dead in subsequent years. If a tree re-burned in a subsequent fire, and post-fire injury and status information were available after that fire, then a new record (row) was made for that tree after the second fire.

Individual studies may have collected more detailed beetle attack data, but for the purposes of creating FTM database and evaluating FOFEM, we collapsed all attack data into either presence or absence.


DATA MEASUREMENTS AND CALCULATIONS

Measurements of fire-caused injuries included percent crown volume scorched, percent crown length scorched, percent crown volume killed, bark char height, and cambium kill rating. 

When possible, we calculated unmeasured variables from those measured in the field to align with other datasets. Specifically, we calculated:
pre-fire crown length = pre-fire tree height − pre-fire height of the base of the crown; and 
post-fire crown length = post-fire tree height − post-fire height of the base of the crown.

In some cases, tree height was only measured before the fire, and in those cases we used the pre-fire height measurement to calculate the post-fire crown length:
post-fire crown length = pre-fire tree height − post-fire height of the base of the crown.

Using the pre- and post-fire crown length we could calculate the measured and percent of crown length scorched: 
crown length scorched = pre-fire crown length − post-fire crown length; and
percent crown length scorched = 100*(crown length scorched/ pre-fire crown length).

To calculate percent crown volume scorched (CVS) from other measurements, we followed the equation provided in the FOFEM help manual (Lutes et al. 2019), which is a rearranged version of the equation derived in Peterson and Ryan (1986).

CVS = 100*CLS*(2*CLpre - CLS)/(CLpre*CLpre)

Where:
CVS = percent crown volume scorched; 
CLS = crown length scorched; and
CLpre = pre-fire crown length.

If pre-fire crown volume that was scorched or consumed by fire and pre-fire crown length that was scorched or consumed by fire were measured or visually estimated in the field, then we used those field-based observations instead of calculated values. Likewise, if was measured in the field, we used that measurement of injury, instead of the change from pre-fire to post-fire crown base height for subsequent calculations. In cases where calculations produced impossible values of &lt;0 or &gt;100, we set those values to an “unknown” value, and exclude those records from this analysis. 

Bark char height (BCH) in this study is the average (as opposed to the maximum) vertical height (m) from ground of blackened bark on a tree bole. Char is blackened residue of bark resulting from incomplete combustion and a coarse indicator of the duration the tree bole was exposed to flames and heat from the fire. Cambium kill rating (CKR) is an estimate of the amount of cambium kill and stem injury from fire (Hood et al. 2010). Measurements of CKR requires removing a small sample of bark at four locations at a tree’s base, to determine if the death of the vascular meristematic tissue (i.e. cambium tissue located between bark and secondary xylem/wood) during fire. Typically, four measurements around the bole are taken, and CKR is the sum of the number of quadrants with dead cambium.

      <procstep>
        <procdesc>Below is a list of changes made to the 1st edition of the FTM database resulting in this 2nd edition.
		
FTM_TREES.CSV  SUBSTANTIAL CHANGES

1. Changed the format of live / dead status for years where data were not collected in the field. Previously we filled in those values, in the following order: (1) if a tree was dead, its status in subsequent years where no field measurements occurred was set to dead; (2) if a tree was live, its status in previous years (either where not field measurement was made or when it was listed as dead based on field observations) was changed to live. 

Leaving NAs in in observed years allows for accounting of field-observations versus no field observation in the modeling structure. User can still fill in unobserved live and dead values in years observations did not occur, but now the observation years can be determined from the data.

2. After doing this, we corrected the values of a small number of trees that had been observed as dead and then observed as alive, when there were additional notes or data that helped us confirm which status was correct. When we could not confirm the status of the trees, we did not correct the “Zombie” trees. We wanted to retain them because they were alive before the fire and could be used to calculate pre-fire density, if desired.


FTM_TREES.CSV MINOR CHANGES

1. Data from the National Park Service Fire Monitoring program were resampled and reformatted to match the FTM database format, and the following changes were made during this process:
a. Corrected errors in the years that plots had burned plot.
b. Constrained dates to final years covered in source data. 
c. Updated the function to derive dates from a second burn to allow for inclusion of earlier records.
d. Names to two fires in were corrected so entries in the FTM_Trees.csv match the FTM_Fires.csv
e. Did better screening out of “0” values for Canopy Volume Scorched (CVS). In the source data, sometime 0s were listed, but 0s were actually representing no measurements, or true NAs.

2. Corrected the coding of live / dead status in three dataset: 
a. Breece dataset: corrected the year of mortality for a subset of fires, which were off by one year.
b. Dickinson dataset: removed trees that were dead before the fire.
c. Bakker dataset: corrected incorrect coding of status data in the incorrect year. 

3. Corrected Canopy Volume Scorched (CVS) values so they included the Canopy Volume Consumed (CVC) measurements in both datasets from Pole Creek fire.


FTM_FIRES.CSV MINOR CHANGES

1. The plot size on the Keyser dataset was changed from 0.03 hectares to the correct size of 0.3 hectares.
