      <abstract>This data publication contains data from a study that evaluated long-term (15-30 year) post-fire regeneration patterns across eastern Washington. These data include both: 1) field-based measurements on seedling and sapling (&lt; 4-meter[m]) height regeneration, overstory tree (&gt; 4-m height), and understory vegetation, and 2) remotely sensed fire severity (Monitoring Trends in Burn Severity; Eidenshink et al. 2007), 30-year climate normals and post-fire weather (climateWNA; Wang et al. 2016), and topography data (National Elevation Dataset, http://ned.usgs.gov/). The study area was located within the Okanogan-Wenatchee and Colville National Forests. A total of 248 sample sites were visited in summer 2017 and represented a gradient of dry, moist, and cold-dry mixed-conifer forest types. Sites were selected within salvage logged and untreated areas and were selected exclusively in moderate and high severity fire patches. Field sampling occurred within a fixed 16-m radius circular plot within which four subplots (which varied in size depending on initial assessment of regeneration densities) were established at cardinal directions, where tree regeneration was tallied by species and height class.</abstract>
      <purpose>These data were collected for ecological research purposes.</purpose>

    <complete>"Unknown", "NA", and blank cells are used to denote missing data. See the Notes column for each data set for additional information. Unknown for Planted, PCT, and salvage would indicate that it was not possible to determine if that type of management was conducted in the field. The rows where most of the information is blank cells are those plots that were abandoned. Most of those say that the plot was moved or abandoned in the notes. Blank UTM coordinates suggest missing UTM data and NAs in the time_off field were just not recorded. Other NAs indicate the attributes were not recorded in the field (e.g., missing data). Often NAs are labelled with "Missing Data" in the Notes field.</complete>

        <methdesc>STUDY AREA AND DESIGN
		
Our sample sites focused on three classes of mixed-conifer forest‚Äîdry, moist, and cold-dry, which were derived from U.S. Forest Service potential vegetation maps and classifications. These types were chosen because they occupy a range of climatic conditions that vary in the evaporative demand placed on tree establishment and growth, represent the majority of forest land-scapes, are regularly influenced by wildfires, and are the focus of postfire management.

Our experimental design included three main factors: (1) fire severity (moderate or high), (2) postfire salvage logging (without post-harvest planting) or no postfire management, and (3) potential vegetation type (PVT, dry mixed-coni-fer, moist mixed-conifer, or cold-dry forest. Potential sample sites were retained if they satisfied six criteria: They were (1) within a fire perimeter that occurred prior to 2007, (2) &gt;30 m inside a fire severity patch of moderate or higher severity, (3) within a dry mixed, moist mixed, or cold-dry conifer type, (4) within an area of recent LiDAR acquisition, (5) within 3 kilometers (km) of a road, and (6) suitable for sampling after evaluation with aerial photography. 

In the data files, Plot_IDs identify the main plot or the sample site. Subplots were located within each main plot where tree regeneration and non-tree regeneration were sampled.  


DATA COLLECTION

A total of 248 sample sites were visited in summer 2017 and represented a gradient of dry, moist, and cold-dry mixed-conifer forest types. Sites were selected within salvage logged and untreated areas and were selected exclusively in moderate and high severity fire patches. Field sampling occurred within a fixed 16-m radius circular plot within which four subplots were established at cardinal directions, where tree regeneration (stems &lt; 4-m height) was tallied by species and height class (&lt; 1-m, 1 to 2-m, 2 to 4-m heights). Subplots varied in size from 16 x 0.5-m (0.0008 ha; n = 36), 16 x 2-m (0.0032 ha; n = 120) to the full 16-m circle (0.08 ha; n = 92), depending on initial assessment of regeneration densities. 

Plot identification numbers follow a pattern beginning with a series of randomly generated numbers and a three-letter acronym where 1) the first letter represents forest type: D) dry mixed-conifer, M) moist mixed-conifer, and C) cold forest, 2) the second letter represents fire severity: M) moderate, H) high severity, and 3) the third letter represents management: N) no management, S) salvage harvested with no planting. 

Seed Source Info: Distance to seed trees were measured in the field from plot center to the base of each tree. A seed tree is defined here as a species of mature seed-bearing tree that would have been alive and reproductive after fire. Similarly, distance to patch edge was measured, where patch edge was determined in the field where the moderate or high severity patch ended and unburned or low-severity burned patches started. 


MODEL DATA

Model data (Model_Data.csv) include data that were collected in the field (e.g., regeneration, seed tree, overstory data) and that were remotely sensed (e.g., climate, post-fire weather, topography data). Columns C-N represent regeneration densities measured in the field for all species (C), for individual species (D-M), and for non-conifer species (N). Live and dead tree overstory density (TPH; trees per hectare [ha]), basal area (BA; m¬≤ ha-1), and quadratic mean diameter (cm) data were also collected in the field and represented in columns S-AS. These data are recorded for all trees and for individual species. The distance to nearest seed tree (in meters) were also measured in the field from the plot center to the nearest mature tree of each dominant conifer species and are represented in columns AT-BF. Plot center locations were also measured in the field and represented in both latitude and longitude (BG, BH), and in albers projection (BI, BJ). Distance to road (d2r, column BL) was measured using a GIS for each plot. Fuel model was also assessed in the field (column BM), the number of fires (BN) and fire severity (rdnbr) class (BO) was assessed using MTBS burn severity data (Eidenshink et al. 2007). Severity class 2 is moderate severity, and class 3 is high severity. AET.x (BQ) and DEF (BR) are actual evapotranspiration and climatic water deficit calculate by Derek Churchill and Sean Jeronimo (unpublished, available upon request). Topography variables were derived in GIS (BS-BW). Time since last fire (tslf; BX) was assessed in GIS using MTBS data. USDA Forest Service membership was assessed in GIS using the Administrative Forest Boundaries data set from the USDA Forest Service National Datasets (https://data.fs.usda.gov/geodata/edw/datasets.php). Climate data: MAT (mean annual temperature; column CA), MAP (mean annual precipitation; CB), Reference Evapotranspiration (Eref, CC), climatic moisture deficit (CMD, CD), and actual evapotranspiration (AET.y, CE) were all derived from climateWNA (Wang et al. 2016). Percentile weather conditions MATp (CF), MAPp (CG), Eref (CH), CMDp (CI), AETp (CJ) were similarly derived from climateWNA and represent percentile post-fire weather conditions (1-3 years post-fire) based on a 50-year time series of weather data 1965-2016. Understory vegetation were also measured in the field and include percent shrub cover (shrb_pcov, CN), average shrub height (meters, shrb_avht, CO), maximum shrub height (meters, shrb_mxht, CP), percent grass cover (grs_pcov, CQ), average grass height (meters, grs_avht, CR), maximum grass height (meters, grs_mxht, CS).

        <srccontr>30-year climate normals and post-fire weather data were obtained using the desktop application climateWNA (Wang et al. 2016): http://www.climatewna.com/. 
		
Specifically, MAT (mean annual temperature; column CA), MAP (mean annual precipitation; CB), Reference Evapotranspiration (Eref, CC), climatic moisture deficit (CMD, CD), and actual evapotranspiration (AET.y, CE) were all derived from climateWNA.</srccontr>

        <srccontr>We obtained a 1/3 arc-second (~10 m) digital elevation model (DEM) from the National Elevation Dataset (http://ned.usgs.gov/), and re-projected the elevation data to 30-m resolution using bilinear interpolation.</srccontr>

Field data was summarized using abundance statistics at the plot scale. 
		
For regeneration (i.e., all stems &lt; 4 m height) the density of regenerating stems was calculated for each subplot based on the count of stems in a subplot and the area of the subplot, which was determined in the field and documented in the Seed_Sap column of the Plot_Data.csv (S = 16 x 0.5-m (0.0008 ha), M = 16 x 2-m (0.0032 ha) to the L = full 16-m circle (0.08 ha; n = 92)).

    <overview>
      <eaover>Below you will find a list and description of the files (8) included in this data publication.

All data files are provided as comma-separated values files.

1. \Data\Variable_Descriptions.csv: List and description of each of the variables found in the data files included in this package. 
Columns in this file include:
Worksheet = name of worksheet
Variable = name of variable
Description = description of variable
Units or Code Descriptions = units for variable, or if variable is categorical codes are defined

2. \Data\Heights.csv: Overstory tree heights measured in the full 16-meter (m) main plot. Heights were measured on a subsample of 3-9 trees depending on the number of species present. File includes Height, total crown ratio (TCR), and compacted crown ratio (CCR). 

3. \Data\Model_Data.csv: Plot-level summaries used to summarize plot- and treatment-level regeneration summaries, and regression modeling. Includes data summarized to the main-plot level from Plot_Data.csv, Seed_Sap.csv, Seed_Source.csv, Overstory.csv, and Non_Tree.csv. 

4. \Data\Non_Tree.csv: Non-tree vegetation sampling. Categories are tall shrubs (TS, &gt; 2 m); shrubs (S, 0.5 m - 2 m tall); sub-shrubs (&lt; 0.5 m tall) and forbs/herbs combined (SS); pinegrass (Calamagrostis rubescens) only (PG); and all graminoids including pinegrass (GR). Data include percent cover, average height and maximum height. 

5. \Data\Overstory.csv: Overstory tree data collected within the 16-m main plot. Data were collected for live and dead trees &gt; 4 m tall and include species, diameter, and tree status. Snag decay classes (Maser et al. 1979) include D1 (Snag decay class 1), D2 (Snag decay class 2-3), and D3 (Snag decay class 4-5). 

6. \Data\Plot_Data.csv: Plot information such as whether it was measured or abandoned, whether there was evidence of planting, pre-commercial thinning, and/or salvage. It also denotes the size of the seedling/sapling subplots, the GPS coordinates and fuel model. (Note: this file contains data for the 248 plots in this study and the additional plots denoted as abandoned.)

7. \Data\Seed_Sap.csv: Seedling and sapling (&lt; 4 m height) field data collected from each regeneration subplot. 

8. \Data\Seed_Source.csv: Data representing the distance from plot center to individual mature seed trees. Seed trees are those that are &gt; 10 inches DBH, or &gt; 25 feet tall, or a tree that has visible reproductive structures (cones, seeds, flowers, etc.) seed, flowers. Also recorded was the edge of the stand-replacing burn patch, defined as a group of ‚â• 10 live, reproductively mature trees.
