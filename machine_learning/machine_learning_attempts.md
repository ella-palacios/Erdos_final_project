# Machine Learning Attempts Documentation
Here we can put which ideas and models we have tried along with their performance stats:
accuracy, precision, error rates, etc.

- I'm going to add the most recent fire year and size, along with the number of fires in between measurements as features to predict on. 
- Maybe use one binary model to choose between alive and dead, then another trained on alive trees to specify damages to the alive tree.  
- I'm going to look at CATBOOST, which is a decision tree boosting algorithm for datasets with a lot of categorical variables
- Seems like decision trees could be good in general, then bagging.
